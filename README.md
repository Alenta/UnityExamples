# UnityExamples
This is a small project where I'm trying to set up a few different tests in Unity.

## Menu System
Preview and select available scenes. Built with UIToolkit.

## Conveyorbelt
A simple scene with a 3D conveyorbelt that animates and can move objects with different types of logic.
Some 3D physics experiments; Stacking cubes, bouncing cubes etc.

## Lerp Visualiser
A small 2D scene that can compare different types of interpolation. 
Custom editor script that can add new objects to compare, and assign them an interpolation type.
Currently available: Lerp without frame-dependence, Close to frame-independent Lerp, </br>
Exponential Decay (similar output to Lerp-smoothing but with higher accuracy) and Vector3.MoveTowards.

The scene can simulate low framerates, though I'm not sure how accurate this actually is. 

## Shaders
Some simple custom shaders. VFX, Water, Ice, Fire, I'll keep adding when new shaders look good enough.

## Splines
Setting up a scene where you can set splines in the scene view, then Instantiate or extrude a custom mesh along that spline.
